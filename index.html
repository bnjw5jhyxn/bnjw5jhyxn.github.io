          Compositionally reinforcement learning
          December 2020&ndash;present

          We want to design a compositional reinforcement learning algorithm
          that breaks up a complex task into subtasks, solves each subtask,
          and combines the solutions into a procedure for the whole task.
          We will require the user to give a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Research_Institute_Problem_Solver">STRIPS</a>-style specification of the problem,
          and we'll need to specify how the STRIPS predicates correspond
          to states in the reinforcement learning environment,
          but we hope to automate the rest of the process.

          Compositionally training and verifying a controller for an F1/10 car
          September 2019&ndash;November 2020
          with Rajeev Alur, Osbert Bastani, Shaan Vaidya, Kishor Jothimurugan, and Radoslav Ivanov

          We trained a car to drive in a class of configurations of hallways
          and we proved that it doesn't crash (at least in a simulator).
          Our training was compositional in the sense that
          we represented hallways as a sequnece of segments
          (straight, 90&#176; left, 90&#176; right, 120&#176; left, and 120&#176; right),
          trained a controller that can drive the car on each segment type,
          and trained a <q>mode predictor</q> that decides which controller to use at any given moment.
          Our verification was also compositional and proceeded by induction
          on the number of segments in the hallway.
          (For the base case, we needed to assume that
          the car stared in a <q>reasonable</q> position.)
          We submitted this work to PLDI in November 2020.

          Verifying eBPF Programs:
          January&ndash;July 2019
          with Santosh Nagarakatte and Srinivas Narayana
          </dt>
          <dd>
          I wrote a translator
          that takes in eBPF programs written in an assembly-like syntax
          and outputs a Z3 query specifying the relationship
          between its inputs and outputs.
          This project studies the Linux kernel's eBPF verifier with the goal
          of proving its soundness (or finding a counterexample).
          Professors Nagarakatte and Narayana are continuing the project
          with a Facebook Networking Systems Research Award.

          Verifying Assembly Implementations of Cryptographic Algorithms:
          September 2017&ndash;May 2018
          with Jay Lim, Santosh Nagarakatte, and Mihai Andrei
          </dt>
          <dd>
          I wrote some tests for an equivalence checker
          late in this project's development.
          The equivalence checker works on on loop-free programs
          written either in an assembly language or in a DSL
          designed to express cryptographic algorithms.
          The results of the project are published in the paper
          <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~santosh.nagarakatte/papers/casm-verify-cgo-2019.pdf">
            Automatic Equivalence Checking for Assembly Implementations
