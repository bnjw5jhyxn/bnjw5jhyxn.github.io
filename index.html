        Compositional Learning and Verification of Neural Network Controllers:
        September 2019&ndash;November 2020

        We trained a car to drive in a class of configurations of hallways
        and we proved that it doesn't crash (at least in a simulator).
        Our training was compositional in the sense that
        we represented hallways as a sequnece of segments
        (straight, 90&#176; left, 90&#176; right, 120&#176; left, and 120&#176; right),
        trained a controller that can drive the car on each segment type,
        and trained a <q>mode predictor</q> that decides which controller to use at any given moment.
        Our verification was also compositional and proceeded by induction
        on the number of segments in the hallway.
        (For the base case, we needed to assume that
        the car stared in a <q>reasonable</q> position.)

          Compositional reinforcement learning:
          December 2020&ndash;present

          We want to design a compositional reinforcement learning algorithm
          that breaks up a complex task into subtasks, solves each subtask,
          and combines the solutions into a procedure for the whole task.
          The user specifies a set of <q>modes</q> (subtasks)
          and a set of transitions between modes,
          and we assume that the controller has access
          to the label of the current mode.
          If the user-provided modes have good starting regions,
          then simply training a controller for each mode
          and putting them together will produce a good composed controller.
          Our method corrects for bad starting regions in the user-provide modes
          by adjusting the starting regions during training.

          Verifying eBPF Programs:
          January&ndash;July 2019
          with Santosh Nagarakatte and Srinivas Narayana
          </dt>
          <dd>
          I wrote a translator
          that takes in eBPF programs written in an assembly-like syntax
          and outputs a Z3 query specifying the relationship
          between its inputs and outputs.
          This project studies the Linux kernel's eBPF verifier with the goal
          of proving its soundness (or finding a counterexample).
          Professors Nagarakatte and Narayana are continuing the project
          with a Facebook Networking Systems Research Award.

          Verifying Assembly Implementations of Cryptographic Algorithms:
          September 2017&ndash;May 2018
          with Jay Lim, Santosh Nagarakatte, and Mihai Andrei
          </dt>
          <dd>
          I wrote some tests for an equivalence checker
          late in this project's development.
          The equivalence checker works on on loop-free programs
          written either in an assembly language or in a DSL
          designed to express cryptographic algorithms.
          The results of the project are published in the paper
          <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~santosh.nagarakatte/papers/casm-verify-cgo-2019.pdf">
